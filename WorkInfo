This project is designed as a auto-control system that can be used to water flowers.
The control board is RaspberryPi Model 3B.
Three water pumps are used as the implement.
Both the Android control terminal and the control board are connected to the ethernet.
The potential result is that I can use my phone to control all the devices and warning messages will be sent to my phone under certain circumstance.
A public server is used to store data and as a transaction between the phone and the board.
